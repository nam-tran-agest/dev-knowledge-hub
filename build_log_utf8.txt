Error: Turbopack 
build failed with 1 
errors:
./dev-knowledge-hub/s
rc/proxy.ts
Proxy is missing 
expected function 
export name
This function is 
what Next.js runs 
for every request 
handled by this 
proxy (previously 
called middleware).

Why this happens:
- You are migrating 
from `middleware` to 
`proxy`, but haven't 
updated the exported 
function.
- The file exists 
but doesn't export a 
function.
- The export is not 
a function (e.g., an 
object or constant).
- There's a syntax 
error preventing the 
export from being 
recognized.

To fix it:
- Ensure this file 
has either a default 
or "proxy" function 
export.
